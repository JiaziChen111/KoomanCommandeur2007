Examples and exercises from "An Introduction to State Space Time Series Analysis", Koopman &amp; Commandeur (2007).

Excellent resources on replicating this text already exist:  
- [Shigeru Ono](http://elsur.jpn.org/ck/): Beautiful code, but the text is in 
   Japanese, and not sure that the translation does justice to the author's dry humor.  
- [*Radhakrishna*](http://radhakrishna.typepad.com/book-summary-and-r-code-1.pdf): I have not read through
  this yet, but looks detailed and meticulous.
